# ShoppingCart

A simple shopping cart implementation using **vanilla-js**.

_Contentful_ is used to update the contents of the website so that any novice user can also change the contents according to the changing demands and availability and saving the time and hassle to create their own backend to manage the content and thus, making it a user friendly website.

Also it is hosted on _Netlify_, which is a San Francisco-based cloud computing company that offers hosting and serverless backend services for web applications and static websites.
